# E-Commerce Product Class Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a product class in an e-commerce database. The class is designed to manage products in the database and has three main methods for managing product data.

## Features

1. `getProduct()`: 
The `getProduct()` method is used to retrieve all the products that have been created and stored in the product class instance. It returns an array of all the products in the database.

2. `addProduct()`:
The `addProduct()` method is used to add new products to the database. It takes a product object as an argument and adds it to the product array.

3. `getProductById()`:
The `getProductById()` method is used to retrieve a specific product from the product array. It takes an id as an argument and returns the product that matches that id.

## Usage
To use this class, simply create a new instance of the product class and call any of the three methods to manage product data. The `getProduct()` method will return an array of all the products in the database, the `addProduct()` method will add a new product to the database, and the `getProductById()` method will retrieve a specific product from the database.
